This repository contains OzDoc, the fruit of a Master's thesis by ALEXE Simon and FRENYO Peter.
While mainly designed for the Oz progrmaming language, OzDoc is a highly flexible tool that has been designed to be easily adaptable to different languages.

Feel free to use it and improve it with us, as it provides a robust framework containing a powerful and malleable parser along with a template-based documentation generator.

A user and developer manual are available in the Appendix of the paper (available as "OzDoc-Thesis-AlexeFrenyo-2019").
